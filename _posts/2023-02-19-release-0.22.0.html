<p>We are pleased to announce a new release of Automatiko - 0.22.0 </p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Highlights</h2>

<ul>
   <li>Comosite access policy</li>
   <li>Support for custom access policies</li>
   <li>Improved instance sorting for file system persistence</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="section-heading">Comosite access policy</h3>

<p>
  Automatiko comes with <code>AccessPolicy</code> that allows to control access to workflow instances at runtime. Access policies control access
  in a fine grained way and what is the most important they are contextual. This means it can evaluate the content of the instance to grant access
  to it. It can take into account things like:

  <ul>
    <li>initiator of the instance</li>
    <li>current identity (user and the groups)</li>
    <li>data of the instance</li>
    <li>and more</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>
  With this release, a new <code>AccessPolicy</code> was introduced, <code>CompositeAccessPolicy</code>. This policy allows to combine multiple
  access policy to be enforced at once, meaning that all defined policies must be met to gain access to given instance.
</p>

<p>
  To learn more about composite access policy, read dedicated section in <a href="https://docs.automatiko.io/main/0.22.0/components/security.html#_composite_access_policy">Automatiko documentation</a>
</p>


<h3 class="section-heading">Support for custom access policies</h3>

<p>
  Access policies that are delivered by Automatiko out of the box:

  <ul>
    <li><code>Allow All</code> - no restrictions, default access policy</li>
    <li><code>Participants</code> - allows to access the instance to the initiator and users that are currently assigned to active user tasks</li>
    <li><code>Initiator</code> - allows to access the instance only by the user who initiated the instance</li>
  </ul>
  might not be enough. There could be other aspects to cover with access policy such as where the request comes from, check custom group of the user who
  makes the request and more.
</p>
<p>
  To address this, a custom access policy support was provided. Users can now develop their own custom access policy to be used at runtime.
  Custom access policies can take advantage of all compnents of the system becuase they are <code>CDI beans</code> and by that can use injection to gain additional capabilities.
</p>
<p>
  Below is a simple access policy that allows to create instances from locahost only. As can be noticed, this policy gets access to request information to check
  which host is used. This should only be used as example what is required to build a custom access policy.

<h3 class="section-heading">Improved instance sorting for file system persistence</h3>

<p>
  Recenlty introduced sorting capabilities of the workflow instance have been improved for file system persistence. It was mainly focused on efficency of
  looking up instances to avoid too much file system access on each sorting request. This should significanlty improve speed of sorting for bigger volumes
  of data when using file system persistence addon.
