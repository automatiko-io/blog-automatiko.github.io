<p>We are pleased to announce a brand new release of Automatiko - 0.3.0 </p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Highlights</h2>

<ul>
   <li>Kubernetes Operators support based on Java Operator SDK</li>
   <li>Error handling improvements</li>
   <li>Versioned process variables</li>
   <li>Process management UI enhancements</li>
   <li>Variable initializer support for simple types</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="section-heading">Kubernetes Operators support based on Java Operator SDK</h3>

<p>
  Automatiko supports building Kubernetes Operators as workflows that improves visibility into what operator does.
  It provides complete integration with <a href="https://github.com/java-operator-sdk/java-operator-sdk">Java Operator SDK</a>
  that hooks into Kubernetes cluster and registers watchers and more. At the same time it allows to have access to
  Kubernetes API server via Fabric8 Kubernetes client. Workflows can perform operations on Kubernetes API server via
  Service Tasks that get Kubernetes client injected and receive events from Kubernetes via message events.
</p>
<p>
  Automtiko provides support for building operators directly in the Kubernetes cluster with live reload without a need
  to rebuld the image and redeploy. Have a look at <a href="https://mswiderski.blogspot.com/2021/03/kubernetes-operator-with-automatiko.html">this blog post </a>
   to see it in action.

<h3 class="section-heading">Error handling improvements</h3>
<p>
Error handling has been improved to collect more information and present them in more accessible way.

<ul>
  <li>Unqieue error identifier</li>
  <li>Short and descriptived error message</li>
  <li>Error details that can have relatively long information depending on the error</li>
</ul>

There is additional error section in Process management UI providing extra capabilities around error handling.
</p>

<h3 class="section-heading">Versioned process variables</h3>
<p>
  Data objects can now be tagged as <code>versioned</code> which will automatically track changes to them
  and make a copy to any non null values. That will then build up a list of versions given variable had.
  Versions are also avaiale to be easily accessed in the workflow definition which enables use cases
  that requite comparing received data with already processed. Users can easily get access to
  <ul>
    <li>the complete list of versions by refering to variable: <code>person$</code></li>
    <li>previous version of the variable <code>previousVersion(person$)</code></li>
    <li>any version by version number <code>variableVersion(person$)</code></li>
  </ul>
  Above variables can be easily accessed in script tasks and any conditions like gateway or conditional events.

    <li>In case of an error you can either retrigger or skip failed activitiy</li>
    <li>Marks failed workflow instances in the Instances table</li>
    <li>Display variables that are versioned with thier versions to compare or revert to</li>
    <li>Workflow instance image has both completed and active nodes annotated</li>

<h3 class="section-heading">Variable initializer support for simple types</h3>
<p>
  Automatiko allows to tag variables (aka data objects) as <code>auto-initialized</code> which will ensure that the
  variable is initialized at the start of workflow instance. With this release there is alos support for simple types
  <ul>
    <li><b>boolean</b> will have value set to <code>false</code></li>
    <li><b>any number type</b> will have value set to <code>0</code></li>
    <li><b>string</b> will have value set to <code>empty string</code></li>
  </ul>
