<p>We are pleased to announce a new release of Automatiko - 0.10.0 </p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Highlights</h2>

<ul>
   <li>Workflow as function flow improvements</li>
   <li>Workflow as function improvements</li>
   <li>Support for multi module projects</li>
   <li>Workflow instance metadata on service interface</li>
   <li>Export and import support with external file storage</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="section-heading">Workflow as function flow improvements</h3>

<p>
  Workflow as function flow has been significantly improved to provide support for subprocesses that
  act as functions. So users can use more advanced constructs to allow use of process composition
  for function flows as well.
</p>
<p>
  In addition, workflow as a function flow is now fully version aware meaning it will use version
  number of the workflow to include in the Cloud Event type attribute so events sent are versioned
  in the same way as workflow itself.
</p>
<p>
  Lastly, workflow as a function flow allows to use message events (both catch and throw) to
  publish events that will be consumed by other services or functions. For catching messages
  that are used for receiving messages allow to have two types of correlation:
  <ul>
    <li>explicit - sent workflow instance id as subject attribute of Cloud Event message</li>
    <li>resolved - based on <code>correlationExpression</code> defined on the message to find which workflow instances should consume the message</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>
  Have a look at <a href="https://docs.automatiko.io/main/0.10.0/workflow-function-flow.html">Automatiko documentation</a>
  for more information about fault workflow as a function flow.
</p>


<h3 class="section-heading">Workflow as function improvements</h3>

<p>
  Workflow as a function has also been improved especially in terms of deployment options. Archetype for
  workflow as a function flow comes with preconfigured maven profiles for

  <ul>
    <li>Azure Functions - profile name is <code>azure</code></li>
    <li>Google Cloud Functions - profile name is <code>gcp</code></li>
    <li>Amazon Lambda - profile name is <code>lambda</code></li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>
  A brand new example <a href="https://docs.automatiko.io/main/0.10.0/examples/userregistration-function.html">User registration function example</a>
  has been provided that illustrates workflow as a function in action that can be deployed to Azure Functions or
  Google Cloud Functions.
</p>

<p>
  Have a look at <a href="https://docs.automatiko.io/main/0.10.0/workflow-function.html">Automatiko documentation</a>
  for more information about workflow as a function.
</p>

<h3 class="section-heading">Support for multi module projects</h3>

<p>
  Until version 0.10.0 Automatiko allowed to use only local (existing in the project resources) workflow definitions.
  That caused rather hard limit on reuse of workflow definitions so users were forced to always copy workflow definitions
  between projects. With this release you can take advantage of multi module projects which allows to simply rely on
  dependencies to include in the project and main (top level) project will be the one that will have access to all workflow
  definitions.
</p>
<p>
  Have a look at <a href="https://github.com/automatiko-io/automatiko-engine/tree/main/integration-tests/automatiko-include-models">sample project using this approach</a>.

<h3 class="section-heading">Workflow instance metadata on service interface</h3>

<p>
  Service interface (REST or GraphQL) exposes workflow data but do not allow to get access to some workflow instance metadata such as

  <ul>
    <li><code>id</code> - unique identifier in UUID format</li>
    <li><code>businessKey</code> - optional alternate key that is more domain specific</li>
    <li><code>description</code> - description of the workflow instance</li>
    <li><code>state</code> - state of the workflow instance (active, completed, etc)</li>
    <li><code>tags</code> - workflow instance tags that can be used for correlation</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
  This is quite useful to know when interacting with service interface and to provide more context information on the client. For instance
  building list of instances thatcan be easily annotated with tags the workflow instance has. This is now possible and can be controlled
  on individual request level.
</p>
<p>
  Metadata is disabled by default and requires to be explicitly asked for. REST api allows to simply enable it via
  <code>metadata=true</code> query parameter and this will attach <code>metadata</code> attribute to the response.
</p>

<h3 class="section-heading">Export and import support with external file storage</h3>

<p>
  Automatiko 0.9.0 introduced support for files stored in external locations (like file system, Amazon S3, Google Storage)
  but that feature was not supported for importing and exporting of workflow instances. 0.10.0 release fills this gap
  and properly handles files stored in external locations to

  <ul>
    <li>upon export external file content is fetched and assigned to exported document</li>
    <li>on import files are stored in external location automatically</li>
  </ul>
