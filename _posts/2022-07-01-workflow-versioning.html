<h2 class="section-heading">Workflow versioning</h2>

<p>
  In Automatiko workflows are the base artifact that the service, function or function flow is built from. And by that they are
  considered the entry point from the consumer point of view. Workflows as any other software component will evolve over time,
  somtimes gracefully without major (or breaking) changes and sometimes there will be a need for more drastic change in business
  logic.
</p>
<p>
  Versioning on the other side is one of the most popular approaches to evolve your services in controlled and safe way.
  When it comes to workflows, it's no different. Workflows, on all levels - meaning regardless if they are top level
  workflow or a subworkflow - can be versioned.
</p>

<p>
  First and foremost is to identify when to change the version of your workflows. By introducing version of the workflow in
  Automatiko this will directly translate to the service api (both ReST and GraphQL). So by that the consumers of the service will
  be affected in a way that they need to switch to the new version as soon as they will be able to.

<h3 class="section-heading">So when to change the version?</h3>
<p>
  Best answer to that is when the change introduced is not backward compatible. Meaning currently running workflow instances
  cannot continue on it. To give an example a non backward compatible change is remove of an activity of the workflow that
  is a wait state activity. Wait state activity is an activity that workflow instance can pause on. As this means such activity will
  be stored as part of the instance state. When it is removed and the version is not changed, all instances that are in that activity
  will no longer work and by that will be in sort of a dead end state.
</p>
<p>
  The same applies to data model, if the change introduces new fields of the data model then it is considered to be compatible
  unless new fields are required and they do not have any default value.
</p>
<p>
  So as long as the changes are compatible keep the version unchanged.
</p>

<h3 class="section-heading">How versioning works in Automatiko</h3>

<p>
  Workflows that are versioned will expose that version number via service api. Depending on which service interface is used
  it will be as following
  <ul>
    <li>REST - service operation path will be prefixed with version number <code>/v1/parts</code> where 1 is the version number</li>
    <li>GraphQL - queries, mutations and subscriptions names will be suffixed with version number <code>create_parts_1</code></li>
  </ul>
  So as you can see there is no need to do extra work to make the service apis to be versioned as well.
</p>

<span class="caption text-muted">Set version of the workflow via properties.</span>
<p>
  Worth mentioning is also the fact that workflows that are versioned needs to take into account messaging aspect. Espeically
  important is the consumer of messages. This is usually represented as
  <ul>
    <li>message start event</li>
    <li>intermediate message event</li>
    <li>boundary message event</li>
  </ul>
  The reason why it is important to take this into account is that if different versions of the workflow will listen on
  the same queue or topic they might "steel" messages from each other. There can be different approaches to this problem

  <ul>
    <li>for start events it might be as simple as removing the message event to allow to only start new instances from latest version</li>
    <li>for any type of message event easiest is to use dedicated queues/topics to separate consumers</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>
  Last but not least when using workflow as function of workflow as function flow versioning is also taken into account. For
  instance with workflow as a function flow that relies on cloud events the cloud event's type attribute includes the version suffix
  <code>org.acme.travels.greetings.v2_2</code> that corresponds to workflow version <code>2.2</code>
</p>

<h3 class="section-heading">Versioning best practice</h3>

<p>
  The most important best practice is to change version only when introducing non backward compatible change. Other best practices are:

  <ul>
    <li>When creating new version start from a copy of the current version and expand from there</li>
    <li>Use number based versioning as it will allow to calculate latest version</li>
    <li>Run multiple versions at the same time as long as there are active instances of the older versions then remove unused versions</li>
    <li>Use export / import features of process management addon to migrate between versions</li>
  </ul>

  These are just few bullet points that could become quite handy when versioning your workflows and by that your service apis.
  Other will emerge once you start putting this into real life use cases.
</p>

<h3 class="section-heading">Routing between versions</h3>

<p>
  Introducing versions of the workflow, introduces versions of your api. In most of the cases this will not cause any issues
  but will require migration for consumers of the service to latest version. To ease with that, maintainers of the service
  can turn on feature called <code>route to latest version</code>. The main purpose of this feature is to allow requests to
  use unversioned paths e.g. <code>/parts</code> instead of versioned one like <code>/v2/parts</code>.
</p>
<p>
  This mechanism is smart enough to find out if the request can be safely routed to latest or not. The main decision point
  for it is the existence of instance identifier. If operation contains instance id then it is routed to the version that
  instance belongs to, but if the operation does not have instance id then it goes to the latest version. Following are examples
  of both operations:

  <ul>
    <li><code>GET - /parts/12345</code> -  will go to version that hosts part with id <code>12345</code></li>
    <li><code>POST - /parts</code> - will start new part instance on latest</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
  To enable that add <code>quarkus.automatiko.service-route-to-latest=true</code> inside the <code>application.properties</code>
</p>

<p>
  <b>NOTE: This routing is supported only for REST service interface</b>
</p>

<h3 class="section-heading">Instance migration between versions</h3>

<p>
  As soon as we introduce multiple versions of the workflow a common question is how to migrate between versions.
  This is quite complex topic as the most important parts are
  <ul>
    <li>how to map not compatible activities?</li>
    <li>how to migrate data model?</li>
  </ul>
  There is no simple answer to that, but luckily Automatiko comes with an export/import feature that comes with
  process management addon. With this we can export complete workflow instance (including all their dependencies
  like sub instances, files, timers etc.) and then import it into another versions of the workflow. Since the
  exported instance is represented as JSON it can be used to manipulate it to fit into the new version requirements.
</p>

<p>
  Although export/import provides a way to migrate instances between versions it is not a complete and automatic mechanism
  to move high volumes of instances. There will be a need to do some alterations between export and import.
</p>

  to evolve your service based on workflows.
