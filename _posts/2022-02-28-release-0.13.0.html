<h3 class="section-heading">Operator archetype equipped with getting started assets</h3>

<p>
  Automatiko comes with dedicated maven archetypes for various types of services that Automatiko can be used for. Kubernetes Operator is one
  of them and with this release it got enhanced to make it easier to get going with your first Kubernetes Operator based on workflows.
</p>


<p>
It is as simple as these three commands to get your first operator up and running

<pre><code class="language-plain">
  mvn -B archetype:generate                                   \
    -DarchetypeGroupId=io.automatiko.archetypes               \
    -DarchetypeArtifactId=automatiko-operator-archetype       \
    -DarchetypeVersion=0.0.0-SNAPSHOT                         \
    -DgroupId=com.acme.workflows                              \
    -DartifactId=cars                                         \
    -DresourceName=Cars
</code></pre>
<span class="caption text-muted">Generate new project based on operator archetype</span>

<pre><code class="language-plain">
  mvn clean package -Pcontainer
</code></pre>
<span class="caption text-muted">Build container image with operator</span>

<pre><code class="language-plain">
  kubectl apply -f target/kubernetes/cars.com.acme.workflows-v1.yml
  kubectl apply -f target/kubernetes/kubernetes.yml
</code></pre>
<span class="caption text-muted">Deploy CRD and operator into Kubernetes cluster</span>

And that's it! You have a operator up and running, not doing much but all the plumbing covered automatically for you!
</p>


<h3 class="section-heading">Operator handling with many improvements</h3>

<p>
  Automatiko allows to build Kubernetes Operators based on workflows. With this release a lot of improvements have been added, to name few

  <ul>
    <li>Control generation aware property to also receive updates for changes of the status</li>
    <li>Automatic CRD and deployment manifest generation</li>
  </ul>

  With this, building Kubernetes Operators is even easier and provide direct insights into the runtime state of the operator.
</p>

<p>
A complete implementation based on this concepts can be found in form on Tekton Approval Task that can be found <a href="https://blog.automatik.io/2022/02/12/tekton-approvals.html">here</a>.
</p>

<h3 class="section-heading">Multi instance enhancements</h3>

<p>
  Multi instance allows to use a simple construct to represents complex scenarios. Like iterating over collection to perform
  same actions on each item of the collection. A common use case is approvals for each item. To be able to react quickly
  Automatiko 0.13.0 has been improved to support embedded subprocesses and completion conditions on top of multi instance.
</p>


<h3 class="section-heading">Serverless Workflow improvements</h3>

<p>
  In 0.12.0 release there was a complete rework of Serverless Workflow support which got additional improvements in this release. Mainly around
  event handling and filtering.
</p>

<h3 class="section-heading">Migration guide - GraphQL especially</h3>

<p>
  In this release there was a change to support same user task names in different workflow definitions and that made the generated
  endpoints of GraphQL to change. Please have a look at <a href="https://docs.automatiko.io/main/0.13.0/migration-guide/0.13.0.html">migration guide</a> for details.
