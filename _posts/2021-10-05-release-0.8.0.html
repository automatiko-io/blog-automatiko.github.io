<p>We are pleased to announce a new release of Automatiko - 0.8.0 </p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Highlights</h2>

<ul>
   <li>Non blocking service invocation</li>
   <li>Transient variables</li>
   <li>Monitoring of messages and signals</li>
   <li>Identity functions</li>
   <li>GraphQL service interface dedicated module</li>
   <li>Security context aware GraphQL subscriptions</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="section-heading">Non blocking service invocation</h3>

<p>
Service invocation is one of the most common operation performed by workflows.
Till now, it was always expected to be synchronous or to put it in other words, blocking.
It is not always desired to block the executing thread to wait for response of the service
call. This is even more important when the service is a remote service such as ReST service.
</p>
<p>
With 0.8.0 release it is now possible to use the non blocking approach to improve the overall
execution of the service.
</p>

<p>
To make use of non blocking service invocation your service needs to be one of the following:

<ul>
  <li>Java service with method that return <code>Uni<Type></code></li>
  <li>OpenAPI operation with <code>?mode=async</code></li>
</ul>
With that Automatiko will use the non blocking approach to calling it.
</p>
<p>
  Have a look at <a href="https://docs.automatiko.io/main/0.8.0/components/service-invocation.html">Automatiko documentation</a>
  for more information about non blocking service invocation.
</p>


<h3 class="section-heading">Transient variables</h3>
<p>
Sometimes there is a need to have workflow instance variables that are required for execution but at the same time
should not be stored. In addition, there should be no additional work required from the workflow developer to keep track of
such variables and clean them manually.
</p>
<p>
Transient variables have been introduced to address exactly this need. By tagging data object (aka variable) with
<code>transient</code> tag, it will make the variable to keep its value until workflow instance
is persisted. The value will never be attempted to be persisted and thus on reload the value of the variable will be
<code>null</code>. That simple, no need to keep track of it any more, all handled automatically.
</p>


<h3 class="section-heading">Monitoring of messages and signals</h3>
<p>
  Monitoring of Automatiko has been moved to <code>Micrometer</code> to take advantage of new features. As part of this work
  there were also additional improvements that brings several new metrics
</p>
<p>
  <b>Messages</b>

  <ul>
    <li><code>automatiko.process.messages.received.count</code> - conter for all messages received</li>
    <li><code>automatiko.process.messages.consumed.count</code> - counter for all messages that were received and consumed</li>
    <li><code>automatiko.process.messages.missed.count</code> - counter for all messages that were received and not consumed</li>
    <li><code>automatiko.process.messages.failed.count</code> - counter for all messages that were received but failed to be consumed</li>
    <li><code>automatiko.process.messages.produced.count</code> - all messages that were produced</li>
  </ul>

  <b>Signals</b>

  <ul>
    <li><code>automatiko.process.signals.count</code> - all signals that where received and processed by workflow instance</li>
  </ul>
</p>



<h3 class="section-heading">Identity functions</h3>
<p>
  Working with workflows in secured environment (when access to the service interface requires at least authentication) in many situations
  requires to gain access to information about identity of the current request. For example, to be able to check if given request
  belongs to a user who is a member of given group, or to be able to assign user task based on the caller's identity.
</p>
<p>
  With 0.8.0, there are several functions (that can be directly used in your worklfow definition) that simplify access to
  identity information

  <ul>
    <li><code>identityName()</code> - returns identity name if found otherwise null</li>
    <li><code>identityName(String whenNotFound)</code> - returns identity name if found otherwise the given value</li>
    <li><code>identityProperty(String property)</code> - returns property associated with identity e.g. email</li>
    <li><code>identityProperty(String property, String defaultValue)</code> - returns property associated with identity e.g. email or defaultValue if no such property is found</li>
    <li><code>identityHasRole()</code> - verifies if identity has given role</li>
    <li><code>identityHasAnyRole(String...roles)</code> - verifies if identity has any of the given roles</li>
    <li><code>identityHasAllRoles(String...roles)</code> - verifies if identity has all of the given roles</li>
  </ul>
</p>


<h3 class="section-heading">GraphQL service interface dedicated module</h3>
<p>
GraphQL service interface has been introduced in 0.7.0 and it required non automatiko dependency to be specified.
To make things easier, a dedicated GraphQL addon module has been introduced. It's now as easy as adding following dependency
to your project to enable GraphQL service interface generation.

<pre><code class="language-plaintext">
  &lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;io.automatiko.addons&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;automatiko-graphql-addon&lt;/artifactId&gt;
  &lt;/dependency&gt;
</code></pre>
</p>

<h3 class="section-heading">Security context aware GraphQL subscriptions</h3>
<p>
  As part of the dedicated addon for GraphQL, there has been as well improved support for subscription that now covers following events

  <ul>
    <li>workflow instances created</li>
    <li>workflow instances completed</li>
    <li>workflow instances aborted</li>
    <li>workflow instances in error</li>
    <li>workflow instances changed</li>
  </ul>

  All subscriptions are security context aware meaning events published to these subscriptions will be filtered based on thier identity
  information (name and roles). This will ensure that data pushed to callers will include only data that they are allowed to receive.
