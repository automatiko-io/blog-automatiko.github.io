   <li>Enhancements in producing messages</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="section-heading">MongoDB based persistence</h3>

<p>
  MongoDB is a popular document based data base and provides really good support for cloud based deployments. It has flexible schema
  which allows to build up sofisticated solution in document manner. Workflows have a nice use of such approach where variables of the
  workflow intance can be stored as a sub document and thus can be target for queries.
  Automatiko, with release 0.11.0 comes with support for MongoDB based persistence for both workflow instances and jobs.
</p>

<p>
  Have a look at <a href="https://docs.automatiko.io/main/0.11.0/components/persistence.html">Automatiko documentation</a>
  for more information about MongoDB based persistence.
</p>


<h3 class="section-heading">JMS support for messaging</h3>

<p>
  JMS is still very widely used, even though there is so much focus on newer alternatives like AMQP or Apache Kafka.
  JMS provides very powerful integration within Java ecosystem and nicely works with majority of MoM offerings such as
  IBM MQ, AchtiveMQ and many others. Automatiko introduced support for JMS to allow to cover traditional messaging use cases via workflows
  where messages need to rely on message properties or message selector to only react to messages of interest.
</p>
<p>
  JMS support comes with capabilities to

  <ul>
    <li>consume messages including correlation and message selectors as defined by JMS spec</li>
    <li>produce messages</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>
  Have a look at <a href="https://docs.automatiko.io/main/0.11.0/components/messaging.html">Automatiko documentation</a>
  for more information about JMS messaging support.
</p>

<h3 class="section-heading">AMQP support for messaging</h3>

<p>
  AMQP is gaining more popularity around messaging platforms and thus allows really comprehensive approach to exchange
  messages. Automatiko provides abstraction layer via workflow constructs (like message events) to publish messages
  to various messaging providers. In this release AMQP was added that allows to

  <ul>
    <li>consume messages including correlation</li>
    <li>produce messages including dynamic address </li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>
  Have a look at <a href="https://docs.automatiko.io/main/0.11.0/components/messaging.html">Automatiko documentation</a>
  for more information about AMQP messaging support.
</p>


<h3 class="section-heading">Enhancements in producing messages</h3>

<p>
  When using message events to publish messages to various messaging providers such as Apache Kafka,
  MQTT, Apache Camel, AMQP or JMS there might be a need to gain more control over metadata around the
  message that is being published. To make this possible, Automatiko allows to implement it via
  <code>io.automatiko.engine.api.io.OutputConverter</code> interface. It has <code>metadata</code>
  method that allows to produce metadata instance that is tailored for given messaging provider.
</p>

<p>
  NOTE: While implementing <code>io.automatiko.engine.api.io.OutputConverter</code> it must implement both
  methods (<code>convert</code> and <code>metadata</code>) as it is considered a complete way of taking over control of how
  message metadata and payload is built.
