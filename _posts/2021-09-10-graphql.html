<h2 class="section-heading">Over-fetching and Under-fetching ... here comes GraphQL</h2>

<p>
  Automatiko with version 0.7.0 introduced a GraphQL support for services based on workflow definition. So the first thing that
  comes into mind is - what is GraphQL and then what can it do for me?<br/>
  Let's focus on what the GraphQL is by taking a small quote from <a href="https://graphql.org">GraphQL website</a>.
</p>

<p><i>
GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data.
GraphQL provides a complete and understandable description of the data in your API, gives clients the power to ask for exactly what they need and nothing more,
makes it easier to evolve APIs over time, and enables powerful developer tools.
</i></p>


<p>
  So there are two main aspects that GraphQL is aiming at

  <ul>
    <li>Over-fetching</li>
    <li>Under-fetching</li>
  </ul>

  Let's tackle them one by one and then look at how it is applied in workflows.
</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Over-fetching</h2>

<p>
  Over-fetching means that clients that consume the API fetch too much data, in other words they get more then they need.
  That is usually due to the fact that the REST api (by default) are providing complete data set managed for the given resource path.
  There are differnt options to improve this by following various practices or even going for OData that has filtering built in. <br/>
  GraphQL on the othe hand was designed from ground up to make this a day one feature. It is up to the client to declare what
  shall be returned.
</p>

<span class="caption text-muted">Query to get all vacation instances available to user john with fetching only the data needed</span>
<pre><code class="language-plaintext">
  query {
    get_all_vacations(user:"john@email.com") {
      id,
      employee {
        firstName,
        manager
      },
      requests {
      	request {
          key,
          from,
          to
        }
      }
    }
  }
</code></pre>

<h2 class="section-heading">Under-fetching</h2>

<p>
On the other side there is under-fetching that means there are multiple calls needed to collect all the required data.
With GraphQL you can do this in one call where you specify more than one query
</p>

<span class="caption text-muted">Collect all vacation instances and tasks for selected instance</span>
<pre><code class="language-plaintext">
  query {
    get_all_vacations(user:"john@email.com") {
      id,
      employee {
        firstName,
        manager
      },
      requests {
      	request {
          key,
          from,
          to
        }
      }
    },
    get_vacations_tasks(id:"john@email.com", user:"john@email.com") {
      id,
			name,
      formLink
    }
  }
</code></pre>


<span class="caption text-muted">Returned instances and tasks in single call</span>
<pre><code class="language-plaintext">
  {
    "data": {
      "get_all_vacations": [
        {
          "id": "john@email.com",
          "employee": {
            "firstName": "John",
            "manager": "john@email.com"
          },
          "requests": [
            {
              "request": {
                "key": "travel",
                "from": "2021-11-01T01:00:00",
                "to": "2021-11-03T01:00:00"
              }
            }
          ]
        }
      ],
      "get_vacations_tasks": [
        {
          "id": "892e1392-c2f1-46f8-bda3-51eb45d98802",
          "name": "cancel",
          "formLink": "/management/tasks/link/cmVxdWVzdHN8NDExOTNjZGItZmZiZi0zNmJlLThjZGYtMjMxYjI4YzU0YjE4OjY5MjY2YzY3LWU3NWMtMzQ2ZS1iOWI0LTE0NGIwNTU0MzI2ZHw4OTJlMTM5Mi1jMmYxLTQ2ZjgtYmRhMy01MWViNDVkOTg4MDJ8"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
</code></pre>

<h2 class="section-heading">Put the workflow into the picture</h2>

<p>
So how this can benefit workflow based services? Actually, there is nothing specific to workflows themselves, it is more about the abovementioned
principles (under-fetching and over-fetching) that makes a lot of sense to workflow based services as well. Especially when there are big data sets
that are not always needed to be provided on each call.
</p>

<p>
To give an example, let's look at classic document approval workflow - the document itself will most likely be part of the payload
but it is not always needed to get the content of the document. With GraphQL approach users can fetch information about document but not
the content so making the calls much lighter.
</p>

<p>
Under-fetching in workflows could be to fetch workflow instances in various states or for various definitions in single call.
</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">How to make use of it</h2>

The setup is really simple, it just requires one additional dependency in your service

<pre><code class="language-plaintext">
  &lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;io.quarkus&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;quarkus-smallrye-graphql&lt;/artifactId&gt;
  &lt;/dependency&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>
And that's it! From now on your service will be equipped with GraphQL interface. If you run in dev mode then you can
open up the GraphQL UI that allows to easily build up queries and look at the schema. It is accessible at
<a href="http://localhost:8080/q/graphql-ui">http://localhost:8080/q/graphql-ui</a>
</p>
<br/>
<img class="img-fluid" src="/img/posts/15_1.png" alt="User task form image">
<span class="caption text-muted">GraphQL user interface in dev mode.</span>

<p>
Another worth mentioning note is that GraphQL requires data for each mutation - this is really important when you use
user tasks in your workflow, these tasks must have at least one input and one output defined. If these are not defined, service generation will
fail.
</p>
