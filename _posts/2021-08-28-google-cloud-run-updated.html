<p>Workflow as a function flow powered by completely managed service - Google Cloud Run</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Introduction</h2>


<p>
This is a follow up blog post about Workflow as a function flow on Google Cloud Run that focuses on 0.7.0
release that brings significant improvements in the area.
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://docs.automatiko.io/main/0.6.0/concepts.html#_workflow_as_a_function_flow_waaff" target="_blank">Workflow as a Function Flow</a> is a powerful
 concept that allows to build business logic as complete, end to end use case but takes advantage of serverless platforms based on
 <a href="https://knative.dev" target="_blank">Knative</a> to provide highly scalable and resilient infrastructure.
</p>

<p>
Workflow as a Function Flow by default communicates directly with Knative Broker to
publish events and by that trigger function invocation. This is not possible in managed
service such as <a href="https://cloud.google.com/run" target="_blank">Google Cloud Run</a> and thus to be able to run with same characteristics
use of Google PubSub is introduced. This enforces some additional configuration steps
as relying on Cloud Event type attribute as trigger is not enough.
</p>

<p>
In addition to the type attribute that is the main trigger, a source attribute of a
Cloud event is also used. Luckily, Cloud Run with PubSub associates topic information
(where the message come from) into the source attribute of the Cloud Event delivered by Cloud Run.

This in turn is used by Automatiko to look up proper function to invoke based on the Cloud event attributes
(type and source). Due to that, workflow and its nodes that compose the function
must be additionally annotated to provide the topic information as a source attribute to
filter on. All the details can be found in the Configuration section of this article.
</p>

<p>
A complete example can be found in
<a href="https://github.com/automatiko-io/automatiko-examples/tree/main/user-registration-gcp-cloudrun" target="_blank">this repository</a>
</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Get started with Google Cloud Run</h2>

<p>
Have a look at the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/run" target="_blank">Google Cloud Run documentation</a> to get started with the offering as such. Once you
have environment ready to use you can try it out with Automatiko service running as Function Flow.
</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Configuration</h2>

<h3 class="section-heading">Dependencies</h3>
<p>
  Configuration of the project is rather simple, once you create a project based on
  <code>automatiko-function-flow-archetype</code> there is one additional dependency needed
</p>
<pre><code class="language-xml">
  &lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;io.automatiko.extras&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;automatiko-gcp-pubsub-sink&lt;/artifactId&gt;
  &lt;/dependency&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>
This dependency brings in Google PubSub event sink that will publish events for each function invocation
during the instance execution. All data will flow through the PubSub topics, thus they must be created in advance.
</p>

<h3 class="section-heading">Project configuration</h3>
<p>
Project configuration that resides inside <code>src/main/resources/application.properties</code> requires to have following defined
</p>
<pre><code class="language-plaintext">
  quarkus.automatiko.target-deployment=gcp-pubsub
  quarkus.google.cloud.project-id=YOUR_PROJECT_ID
</code></pre>
<p>
<code>YOUR_PROJECT_ID</code> must be replaced with actual project id that this service will be deployed to.
</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Build and Deployment</h2>

Once the configuration of the service is done and Google Cloud platform account (topics included)
it's time to build it and deploy.

<p>
  To build it it's as easy as just running single command.
</p>
<pre><code class="language-plaintext">
  mvn clean package -Pcontainer-native
</code></pre>

<p>NOTE: This command requires to have Docker installed as it will build docker container wiht native image in it.</p>

Once the service is built as docker image you can push it out to container registry. As an example you can follow these two commands
to push it to Google Cloud Platform container registry.

<pre><code class="language-plaintext">
  docker tag IMAGE gcr.io/GOOGLE_PROJECT_ID/automatiko/user-registration-gcp-cloudrun:latest
  docker push gcr.io/GOOGLE_PROJECT_ID/automatiko/user-registration-gcp-cloudrun:latest
</code></pre>

<p>Following must be replaced with actual values matching your service and Google Project
<ul>
  <li>IMAGE - image id of the built container image</li>
  <li>GOOGLE_PROJECT_ID - id if your Google Cloud Platform project</li>
  <li>automatiko/user-registration-gcp-cloudrun - container image name</li>
  <li>latest - container image tag</li>
</ul>

Once the image is pushed you can deploy the service to Google Cloud Run by executing <code>gcloud</code> scripts.
These scripts are located inside <code>target/scripts</code> folder where you can find both deploy and undeploy scripts.
</p>

<p>
A sample deploy script is illustrated below.
</p>

<pre><code class="language-plain">

  gcloud pubsub topics create io.automatiko.examples.userRegistration.registrationfailed --project=CHANGE_ME

  </code>
</pre>
<p>
These scripts are complete set of commands to successfully push a workflow as a function flow service to Google Cloud Run.
</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Execution</h2>

To start workflow execution (which will execute as function flow) publish new message to the topic
that is linked with the workflow.

<h2 class="section-heading">Conclusion</h2>

<p>
This article introduced you to use Automatiko and its Workflow as a Function Flow to execute
on Google Cloud Run as a managed Knative environment. At the same time to reduce limitation
of having direct access to Knative Broker, it uses Google PubSub as the way of exchanging events to provide
efficient and highly scalable infrastructure.
</p>

<p>
This is just the beginning and number of improvements are in the works such as automatic generation of scripts
to create topics and deploy the service with triggers. So stay tuned and let us know (via twitter or mailing list)
what would you like to see more in this area.
